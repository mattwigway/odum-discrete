To run the exercises in this folder, you need Python and the biogeme, statsmodels, pandas, and numpy packages. If you are already a Python user, install these packages however you normally install packages (note that biogeme is only available through pip, not through conda).
 
If you aren’t, first install Python from https://python.org, then use the Python package manager “pip” to install the necessary packages. On macOS or Linux, you can do this with the command
 
python3 -m pip install biogeme statsmodels pandas
or
python -m pip install biogeme statsmodels pandas
 
depending on how your Python installation is configured (there’s no harm in trying the first one and then trying the second if that doesn’t work).
 
On Windows, the commands are similar but not quite the same:
 
py -m pip install biogeme statsmodels pandas
or
python3 -m pip install biogeme statsmodels pandas
or
python -m pip install biogeme statsmodels pandas
 
Similarly, there’s no harm in trying these in order if you aren’t sure which to use.
 
If you have trouble with the install, feel free to reach out to me or we can address during class on Monday.
 
If you run into errors about compatibility with numpy 2.0, run

python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26.4

(replacing python3 with whatever version of the install command used above) to downgrade to the most recent compatible version of numpy.

I also recommend installing a programming text editor; if you don’t already have one you like I recommend Visual Studio Code.
